    "Let's start by setting up Enzyme and Zygote in our environment to start testing some differentiation. Our primary benchmark is the physical timing of a differentiation operation. In order to measure this we will simply be using the `@time` Julia method. These times will then be compared to measure how fast differentiation is actually done, along with comparing other important benchmarks.\n",
